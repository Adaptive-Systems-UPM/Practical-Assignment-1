1. Advantages of Tag-Based Similarity:
- Tags represent human-curated or algorithmically extracted key concepts
- They reduce dimensionality compared to full-text analysis
- Tags can capture semantic relationships better than raw text for some applications
- Computational efficiency: comparing tag sets is faster than computing TF-IDF or LDA similarities


2. Benefits of Tag-Based Approach:
- Efficiency: Tag comparison is much faster than full-text vectorization.
- Semantic Clarity: Tags capture key concepts explicitly labeled by humans or extraction algorithms.
- Noise Reduction: Tags filter out common words and focus on meaningful concepts.
- Hybrid Approach: Can combine tag similarity with content-based methods for better results.

Conclusion:
Better to use a weighted tag similarity approach where rarer tags contribute more to the
similarity score, similar to IDF weighting in TF-IDF. This gives higher importance to distinctive
tags that better characterize specific topics.
