We tested two tag-based approaches:
•	Jaccard Tag Similarity: 61.88%
•	Weighted Tag Similarity: 59.91%
Both performed well, with simple Jaccard actually achieving the best result of all
methods we tested (slightly better than TF-IDF's 59.92%).


1. Advantages of Tag-Based Similarity:
Tags offer several advantages over content-based approaches. They represent
human-curated or algorithmically extracted key concepts, reducing dimensionality compared to analyzing full text.
Tags explicitly capture what an article is about rather than relying on word frequency statistics. They also filter
out common words and focus on meaningful concepts, which reduces noise.
Computationally, comparing tag sets is much faster than computing TF-IDF
similarities across 161,607 features or running LDA models. Tags can also be
combined with content-based methods in a hybrid approach for potentially even better results.


2. Benefits of Tag-Based Approach:
- Efficiency: Tag comparison is much faster than full-text vectorization.
- Semantic Clarity: Tags capture key concepts explicitly labeled by humans or extraction algorithms.
- Noise Reduction: Tags filter out common words and focus on meaningful concepts.
- Hybrid Approach: Can combine tag similarity with content-based methods for better results.

3. Jaccard vs Weighted Approach
Interestingly, simple Jaccard similarity (61.88%) slightly outperformed our
weighted approach (59.91%). We implemented the weighted method to give 	rarer tags more importance, similar to
IDF weighting in TF-IDF. However, this 	suggests that for Food & Drink, common tags like "Taste," "bruger," or
"baking" are actually valuable discriminators rather than noise. The weighting 	may have over-emphasized niche
tags that appear in only a few articles, reducing the ability to find similar mainstream content.

4. Conclusion:
Tag-based similarity proved to be the best-performing method overall for Food & Drink categorization.
While the improvement over TF-IDF was modest (about 2 percentage points),
tags offer significant computational advantages and would likely show even greater benefits for categories like
Sports where content-based methods struggled. For future work, a weighted approach might still be valuable,
but the weights should be calibrated based on the specific 	category characteristics rather
than blindly following TF-IDF's IDF weighting scheme.
