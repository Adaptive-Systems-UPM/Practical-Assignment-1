1. Performance Drop Analysis
TF-IDF Performance Drop: Sports achieved 38.73% compared to Food & Drink's 59.92% — a 35.4%
relative decrease in quality. This represents 305 fewer correct matches (731 vs 426 goods),
confirming that Sports articles are substantially harder to cluster by lexical similarity.

LDA Catastrophic Failure: Sports LDA achieved only 5.91% compared to Food & Drink's 38.77% —
an 84.7% relative decrease. This is a dramatic collapse,
indicating that the 30-topic LDA model completely fails to capture Sports category coherence.
Only 65 out of 1,100 possible matches were correct, suggesting LDA topics are fragmenting
Sports content across multiple unrelated.

2. Why Sports Results Are Much Worse
Based on your results and the theory materials, here are the validated explanations.

Vocabulary Diversity (Confirmed): Sports encompasses distinct sub-domains
(football, basketball, tennis, racing, etc.), each with specialized terminology.
A football article about "quarterback," "touchdown," and "offense" shares minimal
vocabulary with a tennis article about "serve," "rally," and "ace."
TF-IDF struggles because there's no consistent term overlap within the Sports category.

Topic Fragmentation in LDA: The devastating LDA performance (5.91%) reveals that with only 30
topics distributed across 5,285 documents, Sports content is being scattered across multiple topics
rather than concentrated. Different sports likely occupy different topic clusters,
destroying category coherence. Food & Drink maintains better topic concentration because culinary
vocabulary (cooking, ingredients, restaurants) co-occurs more consistently.

Generic Terminology: Sports articles frequently use common action words like "win," "compete,"
"score," "team," "player," and "champion" that appear across many news categories (business competitions,
political races, entertainment awards). This creates noise in similarity calculations. Food & Drink uses
more distinctive vocabulary like "recipe," "ingredient," "cuisine," "chef," and "flavor" that rarely
appears in other categories.

Category Breadth: Sports is inherently broader than Food & Drink. While Food & Drink centers on eating,
cooking, and restaurants with overlapping vocabulary domains, Sports spans team sports, individual sports,
athletic competitions, sports business, and athlete profiles — each with distinct vocabularies.

3. Execution Time Insights
Interestingly, LDA model creation for Sports (14.15s) was significantly faster than for
Food & Drink (39.68s), likely due to stopping convergence earlier when topics couldn't stabilize
properly. This faster training time is actually a warning sign of poor model fit.
