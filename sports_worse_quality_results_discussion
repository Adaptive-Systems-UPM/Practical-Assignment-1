1. Performance Drop Analysis
The drop in quality for Sports was substantial. TF-IDF achieved only 38.73% compared to Food & Drink's 59.92% - a
35.4% relative decrease. This represents 305 fewer correct matches, confirming that Sports articles are much harder to
cluster using lexical similarity

LDA's performance was catastrophic for Sports, achieving just 5.91% compared to 38.77% for Food & Drink - an 84.7% drop.
Only 65 out of 1,100 possible matches were correct, suggesting the 30-topic model completely failed to capture
Sports category coherence.

2. Why Sports Results Are Much Worse
There are several reasons why Sports showed significantly worse results than Food & Drink.
First, Sports has much more vocabulary diversity. Most of articles offered talk
about different sports like basketball, soccer, gymnastics. These share almost no 	words, so TF-IDF can't
find matches even though they're both sports content. 	Compare this to Food & Drink where terms like "burgers," "pizza," and
"chicken" appear consistently across different articles.

The LDA failure (5.91%) is particularly revealing. With only 30 topics for the entire document dataset, different sports got scattered into separate topic 	clusters 	instead of grouping together. Basketball, gymnastics, and soccer each likely 	ended up in their own topics, completely fragmenting the Sports category. Food 	& Drink didn't have this problem because culinary vocabulary tends to co-occur 	naturally - recipes mention ingredients, cooking techniques appear alongside 	food names.
Finally, Sports is just a broader category overall. Food & Drink focuses on eating, cooking, and restaurants -
all closely related domains. Sports covers 	team sports, individual athletes, competitions, business deals, and athlete
profiles, each with completely different vocabularies.

Interestingly, LDA model creation for Sports (14.15s) was significantly faster 	than for Food & Drink (39.68s).
This likely happened because the algorithm 	stopped early when topics couldn't stabilize properly - actually a warning sign
of poor model fit rather than an advantage.


3. Execution Time Insights
Interestingly, LDA model creation for Sports (14.15s) was significantly faster than for Food & Drink (39.68s),
likely due to stopping 	convergence earlier when topics couldn't stabilize properly.
This faster training time is actually a warning sign of poor model fit.
