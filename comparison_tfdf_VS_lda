1. Ratio Quality Comparison
TF-IDF achieved significantly better results (59.92%) compared to LDA (38.77%),
meaning TF-IDF correctly identified Food & Drink articles in the top-10 similar documents about
21% more often than LDA.

Why TF-IDF Outperformed LDA:

Vocabulary Specificity: Food & Drink articles likely contain highly specific terminology
(ingredients, cooking methods, recipes, restaurants)
that appears consistently within this category.
TF-IDF excels at capturing this lexical similarity because it directly matches terms.

Topic Granularity: With 30 topics, Food & Drink content may be spread across several topics
rather than concentrated in dedicated ones.
This dilutes the discriminative power for this specific category.

Direct Word Matching: TF-IDF operates at the word level, so articles about "pasta," "wine," or
"restaurant" are directly matched. LDA groups these into broader topics that may also include
tangentially related content.

Dimensionality: TF-IDF uses 161,607 features (unique terms), capturing fine-grained distinctions.
LDA reduces this to only 30 dimensions, losing specific vocabulary signals.

2. Execution Time Analysis
Model Creation:
TF-IDF: 29.13 seconds
LDA: 39.68 seconds (36% slower)
LDA takes longer because it requires iterative Gibbs sampling to discover latent topics,
while TF-IDF only computes term frequencies and inverse document frequencies.

Comparison Time:
TF-IDF: 5.02 seconds
LDA: 0.27 seconds (18.6x faster)
This dramatic difference demonstrates a key advantage of LDA: once the model is built,
similarity computations are much faster because they operate in a compressed 30-dimensional
space versus TF-IDF's 161,607-dimensional space.

3. Trade-offs Between Methods
TF-IDF Advantages:
- Higher accuracy for categories with distinctive vocabulary
- Transparent and interpretable (easy to see which terms drive similarity)
- No hyperparameter tuning required
- Better for well-defined, terminology-rich topics

TF-IDF Disadvantages:
- Slower similarity computations (larger vectors)
- Suffers from synonymy (different words, same meaning)
- Cannot capture semantic relationships
- "Helmet" and "bicycle" would be considered dissimilar despite being related

LDA Advantages:
- Much faster similarity comparisons (compressed representation)
- Can discover semantic relationships through co-occurrence
- Dimensionality reduction aids computational efficiency
- Can reveal latent thematic structure

LDA Disadvantages:
- Lower accuracy for specific category identification
- Requires hyperparameter tuning (number of topics, passes, alpha, beta)
- Topics may not align perfectly with predefined categories
- Less interpretable results
